# WebsiteMapper
WebsiteMapper is a Node.js-driven tool for mapping websites that is in early development. Planned features include the ability to run jobs for automated screenshot taking, quickly extract and analyze elements of a web page's DOM, and generate graphical website maps.

## System Requirements
Being in its early development phase, WebsiteMapper is currently driven by [puppeteer core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-core), and thus it assumes you have already [installed Chromium](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html) on your system. In the future, a branch that relies on the full [puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer) package may be developed to provide a route involving easier installation.
